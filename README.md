This is a project that I've created to demonstrate my current programming skills.
To run the application, install Python, ensure that the pygame module is installed, and simply run it from the main.py file. 

Simple overview of how I coded this application:
Whenever I created this project, I decided to have two overlapping grids. One is called the active grid, and the other is called the passive grid. 
The active grid serves the functionality of displaying the falling pieces, while the passive grid serves the functionality of displaying the placed pieces.
Whenever a collision event happens, whatever is being displayed on the active grid simply gets transferred over to the passive grid.
From there, I've continued to add more and more functionality to the game.
